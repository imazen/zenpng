# Changelog

All notable changes to zenpng are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Performance
- Skip the second full-file chunk scan that the zencodec decode path used
  to perform for `PngProbe` construction. `PngProbe::from_info` now builds
  the probe from decoder state in ~25 ns instead of re-parsing every chunk
  (~85 ns mean, ~635 ns on PNGs with many text chunks — ~17x speedup on
  that worst case).

### Added
- `PngProbe::from_info(&PngInfo)` constructor for building a probe from
  decoder-produced metadata with no extra I/O.
- `PngInfo::palette_size`, `PngInfo::compressed_data_size`, and
  `PngInfo::creating_tool` fields, populated as chunks are walked.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-01

### Streaming Encode (zencodec `Encoder` trait)

- **`push_rows()`/`finish()` streaming API** — encode PNG data incrementally
  without holding the entire decoded image in memory at once.
- **Effort 0: true streaming** — rows emit stored DEFLATE blocks on arrival.
  No intermediate pixel buffer. Peak memory ~1x output size.
- **Effort 1: pre-filtered streaming** — Paeth filter applied per-row on arrival,
  compressed in `finish()`. Peak memory ~2x image (filtered + compress_bound).
- **Effort 2+: buffered** — raw pixels accumulated, full encode in `finish()`.
  Equivalent to one-shot `encode()`.

### Encoding

- 32-effort compression pipeline (effort 0–200) with named presets from
  `None` through `Minutes`
- 4-phase progressive engine: screen → refine → brute-force → recompress
- 9 filter strategies (5 single + 4 adaptive heuristics)
- BruteForce and BruteForceFork per-row filter selection
- Beam search filter optimization
- Transparent pixel zeroing for RGBA
- Auto-indexed encoding via `encode_auto()` with pluggable quantizer backends
  (zenquant, imagequant, quantette) and perceptual quality gates (MaxDeltaE,
  MaxMpe, MinSsim2)
- APNG encoding with 6-way dispose/blend optimization and temporal palette
  consistency
- Metadata preservation (sRGB, gAMA, cHRM, cICP, iCCP, eXIf, XMP)
- 16-bit and float input via `bytemuck` + `linear-srgb` SIMD batch conversion

### Decoding

- Streaming row-by-row decode for non-interlaced PNGs
- Adam7 interlaced decode
- SIMD-accelerated unfiltering (Sub, Up, Avg, Paeth) via archmage dispatch
- APNG frame decode with `with_start_frame_index` support
- Configurable checksum verification (CRC-32, Adler-32) — skipped by default
- `PngProbe` with `SourceEncodingDetails` (compression analysis, creating tool
  detection, bits-per-pixel, palette size)
- `PngLimits` for pixel count, memory, output size, and frame count enforcement

### Robustness

- Fuzz targets for decoder
- Validated against 47,366-image corpus (zero pixel mismatches vs `png` crate)
- Overflow-safe IHDR computation (wasm32-safe)
- Non-panicking error paths (`Result` over `.expect()`)
- `ResourceLimits` enforcement for output size, input size, and APNG frames
